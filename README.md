# Udacity Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data Project 

## 01 Aug'20

## **Overview:**
In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered such regular users, short-term and casual users.

    ## **Softwares needed:**
* _Python 3, NumPy,_ and _Pandas_ installed using _Anaconda_
* A text editor, like VS Code or Atom
* A terminal application (i,e., Ma, Linux, Windows)

### **How the program works:**
The code takes in raw input to create an interactive experience that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive as the user's input determines the output. There are four questions that will change the answers:

* Which city would you like to review? Chicago, New York City or Washington?
* Which month would you like to view? January, February, March, April, June or 'all'?
* What day would you like to see? Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or 'all'?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which you'll do data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.
## Evaluated Statistics
### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., month, day of week and hour of day)
### 2 Popular stations and trip
### 3 Trip duration
### 4 User info (counts of each user type)
